* Random programs written in C

** Calculator <04-07-2023 Tue>
- Calculator that will take an expression and then return a result.
- Implementing a stack in order to convert the expression into post-fix notation.

** Singly linked list: <02-07-2023 Sun>
- Easy project that implements a linked list.
- Over-engineered it compared to the tutorial because its more complicated that way and I can learn more.
- Have not made it bug resistant because it relies on the user to give correct data.

** Simple clock
- Program that takes the time from the user, and then prints the time second by second.

*** Problems
- =C-c= does not seem to terminate it when it is within its loop for some reason.
- Have not fully tested all edge cases yet.
